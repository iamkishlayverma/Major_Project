Password-based remote user authentication schemes are widely investigated, with recent research increasingly combining a userâ€™s biometrics with a password to design a remote user authentication scheme that enhances the level of the security. However, these authentication schemes are designed for a single server environment and result in users needing to register many times when they want to access different application servers. To solve this problem, an anonymous multi-server authenticating key agreement scheme based on trust computing using smart cards, pass-word, and biometrics has been introduced. This scheme not only supports multi-server environments but also achieves many security requirements. In addition, it is a lightweight authentication scheme which only uses the nonce and a hash function. From the subsequent analysis, the proposed scheme can be seen to resist several kinds of attacks, and to have more security properties than other comparable schemes.
